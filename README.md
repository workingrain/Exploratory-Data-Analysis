# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
An organization has collected raw data to analyze its operations and support its decision-making processes. 

### Question for Analysis
What is the relationship between specific medical conditions and gender among the patients?
### Benefit from Analysis
Data from this analysis can improve patient care, manage risk, and help make informed policy decisions. 
Firstly, healthcare providers can analyze the most prevalent medical conditions within their patient population. This information allows the allocation of resources more efficiently and design preventive measures for specific medical conditions. Moreover, insurers can use the analysis to assess and manage risk. They can develop more accurate risk, set appropriate premiums and design insurance plans with the healthcare needs of their patients. Lastly, policymakers can use this analysis to inform public health initiatives and allocates resources strategically. They can identify areas of concern and address specific needs of the community. 

### Justification
For this analysis, I used the chi-square test. Since my medical conditions variables (High Blood, Stroke, Diabetes, Overweight, Arthritis, Hyperlipidemia, Back Pain, Anxiety, Allergic Rhinitis, Reflux esophagitis, Asthma) and gender (female, male, binary) are categorical values, the chi-square test can be used to determine whether there is a significant association between these categorical variables against each other. 

###  Results of the hypothesis test
Null hypothesis: There is no significant association between specific medical conditions and gender among the patients. 
Alternative hypothesis: There is a significant association between specific medical conditions and gender among conditions and age among the patients. 
The evidence from the data does not provide enough support to claim that there is a statistically significant relationship between medical conditions and gender. 
###  Limitations of analysis
Failing to reject the null hypothesis does not prove the absence of a relationship. With the available data, I could not find strong enough evidence to support the presence of a relationship between medical conditions and gender. This lack of statistical significance does not negate the importance of the research question. It is important to interpret the results in the broader context of the research goals and the characteristics of the dataset. 
###  Recommended course of analysis
The analysis suggests that there is no significant association between specific medical conditions and age among the patients. Firstly, present findings to stakeholders. Clearly communicate and emphasize that the statistical analysis did not provide evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Then, explore and investigate further the potential reasons for the lack of significant association. Consider exploring additional variables or refining categories. Moreover, perform subgroup analyses based on other relevant factors like age, marital status, or other demographic variables. Furthermore, conduct additional research. Identify areas for further research and determine if there are other variables not included in the current dataset. Lastly, consult with statistical experts to get feedback on your analysis and explore alternative methodologies.
